# webrtc_streamer

A Flutter application that streams video with WebRTC Technology. Meant to be used to test and/or use as a boilerplate to build Video Streaming apps/utilities for platforms supported by flutter.

  
## Getting Started

Use `flutter run` to run the app.

> **Prerquisite:** `flutter` should be installed in the device/virtual environment running the above command.
<br> To use the app for a specific target that **does not** have Flutter installed, build the universal, *web app* (with `flutter build web`)  or the target app platform (with `flutter build <target>`) and use the bundle.
